# Labs

These are my own generated labs.

## Divider (divN)

The code generates a circuit which provides equal probability for all states in the specified range. This range does not need to be a power of two.
And can be used (setting the number options to 365) to demonstrate the 'birthday paradox'.

## Custom Backends

Testing how the different restrictions assigned to a custom backend are reflected in the trasnpiled code being gnerated.
