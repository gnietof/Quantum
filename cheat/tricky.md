# Tricky
A compilation of questions which I have found to be tricky.

## Methods
Questions related with unexisting methods.  
This is specially tricky when dealing with questions which were having Qiskit 1.x (or Qiskit 0.x) in mind.

- What will occur when the following code is executed?
```python
c = ClassicalRegister(2)
c.draw()
```
Neither ClassicalRegister nor QuantumRegister have a draw method. So, an error is returned.


## Parameters
Questions related with less commonly used parameters.

#  Fidelity
I have seen several questions regarding fidelity: state fidelity, average gate fidelity and process fidelity.

## State Fidelity
## Average Gate Fidelity
## Process Fidelity
