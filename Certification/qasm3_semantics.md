# QASM Semantics
There is not much content in this section for the certification. Many sections are related with experimental features in QASM3.
So, the only important sections are the serialization and deserialization ones. 
Regarding other features in the QASM language and differences between QASM2 and QASM3, I compiled more details in this document [QASM Tips](../cheat/tips_qasm.md).
