# Transpiler Passes

This includes a list of classes implementing each of the passes in a transpiler. I wonder if going through this list makes any sense for the certification. 

## Layout Selection

## Routing

## Basis Change

## Optimizations

## Scheduling

## Circuit Analysis

## Synthesis

## Post Layout

## Additional Passes
