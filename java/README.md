# Java
I have been coding in Java since 1996. My first book on Java (we had no learning resources then in the Internet) had a highlight on the top right corner: "Covers Java 1.1"!!!
I will be including here some tests using Java code. 

## QASMClient 
The first one is just an intent to use the REST transpiler. But then I discovered that my Open Plan does not have access to that feature. So I am just including the code in case someone finds it useful. **It is not complete** as I have not been able to process the response from the server.
